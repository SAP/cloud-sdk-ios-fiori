# FioriIntegrationCards

The FioriIntegrationCards module is a native SwiftUI renderer for the [UI5 Integration Cards](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/index.html).  These types of cards are common in UI5 dashboard and overview page user contexts.  In native iOS apps, we are focusing initially on the dashboard use case, and also considering Cards as ideal for Annotation-style views--in maps, or AR experiences.
