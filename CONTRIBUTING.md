## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ðŸ˜Š

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help and 
- **analyze issues**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-ios-fiori/issues?state=open). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
- **report an issue**: do not hesitate to file a  [new issue](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-ios-fiori/issues/new). The more details you can give the better
- **provide feedback**: is the README insufficient or the API documentation unclear? Let us know!

## Submitting code and pull request handling

We are currently busy finalizing our open-source milestone release.

Soon we'll enhance this section to provide more instructions on how to submit a great pull request.

For now please know that a pull request has to pass all status checks to be considered for review by project maintainers.

We reserve the right to close or to not process pull requests.

We recommend to run `setupForCollaborators.sh` in root directory once to install helpful tools. For example, the script will install a pre-commit gith hook to run a SwiftLint check automatically before committing your sources. It will also add a run script to ensure that SwiftLint checks are getting executed when you are working within the Xcode project file.

## Legal stuff

### Contributors License Agreement

We require you to agree and sign a Contributors License Agreement for code contribution.

Sign your CLA [here](https://cla-assistant.io/SAP/cloud-sdk-ios-fiori). You only have to do it once ðŸ˜Š 

This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. 

### Company Contributors

If employees of a company contribute code, in **addition** to the individual agreement above, there needs to be one company agreement submitted. This is mainly for the protection of the contributing employees.

A company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill, and print
the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/master/docs/SAP%20Corporate%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.pdf) form. Then either:

-   Scan it and e-mail it to [opensource@sap.com](mailto:opensource@sap.com) and [cloud-sdk-ios-fiori@sap.com](mailto:cloud-sdk-ios-fiori@sap.com)
-   Fax it to: +49 6227 78-45813
-   Send it by traditional letter to: *Industry Standards & Open Source Team, Dietmar-Hopp-Allee 16, 69190 Walldorf, Germany*
