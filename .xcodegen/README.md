Use command line tool [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to create Xcode project based on `project.yml` specification.

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

Once `FioriSwiftUI.xcodeproj` was generated by XcodeGen command line tool, you are able to build binary frameworks for modules `FioriThemeManager`, `FioriCharts` and `FioriSwiftUICore`

```bash
xcodebuild -project FioriSwiftUI.xcodeproj -scheme buildBinaryFramework
```

which will be placed in `XCFramework` folder.

GitHub action workflow `XCFrameworks` is using project spec in this folder to create binary frameworks for modules of this Swift package.
