The following guide explains how you can generate binary frameworks for `FioriThemeManager`, `FioriCharts` and `FioriSwiftUICore` modules.

You need to install [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) if not present on your machine.

You will need to checkout the commit/branch from which you want to take the sources to generate the binary frameworks.

Next, you need to specify a version for the binary framework's `Info.plist` with an environment variable.

```bash
export FIORISWIFTUI_VERSION="3.2.0"
```

Then run the following command to create the required Xcode project based on `project.yml` specification.

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

Once `FioriSwiftUI.xcodeproj` was generated by XcodeGen command line tool, you can build binary frameworks for modules `FioriThemeManager`, `FioriCharts` and `FioriSwiftUICore` with the following command.

```bash
xcodebuild -project FioriSwiftUI.xcodeproj -scheme buildBinaryFramework -configuration Release
```

> The modules will be build for iOS, iOS Simulator and MacCatalyst. If you need other platforms please change the run script in porject.yml accordingly.

The binary frameworks will be placed in the `XCFramework` folder.

GitHub action workflow `XCFrameworks` can be used by maintainers to build the binary frameworks in a virtual environment.
