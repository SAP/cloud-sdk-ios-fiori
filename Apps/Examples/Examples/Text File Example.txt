QuickLook Editing Tools
iOS 13 brings users a cool new feature: simple editing support for images, PDFs and videos via QuickLook. This lets users preview and edit files from the QLPreviewController. The tools are the same ones you use when previewing a file in Files or editing an attachment in Mail.

QLPreviewController also provides simple support for trimming and rotating videos. This is quite handy when you need to take some notes on a PDF tutorial, for example.
